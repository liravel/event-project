        <p>At this point in time Perc basically equals Industrial Techno ‹‹the thought that counts but not today›› At least all the goodness happening in this field ‹‹look what your love has done to me›› Founding the eponymous Perc Trax label in 2004 ‹‹blind to all colours except for black›› Ali Wells aka Perc began releasing his own banging productions as well as curating an impeccable line of releases crafted by the likes of Ansome, Truss or I Hate Models ‹‹take your body off and show me your veins›› In the meantime his hands soaked in British bloodshed of relentless Techno sound has touched the controls in booths all over the world including Berghain and Tresor ‹‹rotting sound waiting for the right time›› A genuinely perfect match for the sonic approach the hosts of Wrong crew have on their agenda ‹‹horse gum sliding over my tongue›› Needless to say the three founders aka Trauma, Heartsick Mother and Jim Hate will all be djing for a good part of the night as well as our resident nrmn. At this point in time Perc basically equals Industrial Techno ‹‹the thought that counts but not today›› At least all the goodness</p>

            <h1>PERC</h1>
            <p>Perc is one of electronic dance music’s reference points: an internationally touring DJ, label owner and one of the most respected producers in techno today. Known as one of the most forward-thinking individuals in techno Perc (aka London based Ali Wells) fuses current sounds with his extensive knowledge of electronic music’s past to create something new & unique. A regular artist on such scene-leading labels as CLR, Kompakt, Drumcode, Stroboscopic Artefacts and Ovum as well as his own world-reknown Perc Trax imprint, Perc is as uncompromising as he is unique.</p>

            <h1>NRMN</h1>
            <p>A protegee of Moerbeck’s expanding Code Is Law platform, the artist’s current surge into the shadowy realm of dance music has been further supported by Bas Mooy’s MORD label, setting up the producer as a fresh authority to be reckoned with. In addition to stand out all-night sets and back-to-back spots with Moerbeck that headline Code Is Law label nights, his burgeoning career has swiftly seen his bookings fall in alongside artists such as Dax J, Phase Fatale, Stanislav Tolkachev and Kobosil at all manner of venues across Europe. With his music already supported by the likes of Jeff Mills, Tommy Four Seven and Rebekah, the looming presence of NRMN is proliferating the warehouse and darkened corners of contemporary techno.</p>
