            <h1>PERC</h1>
            <p>Perc is one of electronic dance music’s reference points: an internationally touring DJ, label owner and one of the most respected producers in techno today. Known as one of the most forward-thinking individuals in techno Perc (aka London based Ali Wells) fuses current sounds with his extensive knowledge of electronic music’s past to create something new & unique. A regular artist on such scene-leading labels as CLR, Kompakt, Drumcode, Stroboscopic Artefacts and Ovum as well as his own world-reknown Perc Trax imprint, Perc is as uncompromising as he is unique.</p>

In addition to stand out all-night sets and back-to-back spots with Moerbeck that headline Code Is Law label nights, his burgeoning career has swiftly seen his bookings fall in alongside artists such as Dax J, Phase Fatale, Stanislav Tolkachev and Kobosil at all manner of venues across Europe. With his music already supported by the likes of Jeff Mills, Tommy Four Seven and Rebekah, the looming presence of NRMN is proliferating the warehouse and darkened corners of contemporary techno.</p>
